    Our Story at SIEI Bites
  </h2>

  <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <span class="text-yellow-300 font-semibold">SIEI Bites</span> is a student-driven digital canteen solution designed to bring comfort, convenience, and efficiency to your food experience at Siddhartha Institute of Engineering & Technology. Born out of everyday struggles like long queues, delayed orders, and limited visibility into menu items, SIEI Bites was built to redefine the way you interact with your campus canteen.
